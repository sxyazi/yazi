## Yazi - ‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi ("duck" in Chinese) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

üí° A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- üöÄ **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- üí™ **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- üñºÔ∏è **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with √úberzug++, covering almost all terminals.
- üåü **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Encoding**: Combined with the pre-caching mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- üß∞ Integration with fd, rg, fzf, zoxide
- üí´ Vim-like Input component, and Select component
- üè∑Ô∏è Multi-Tab Support, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, directories, code, etc.)
- üîÑ Batch Renaming, Visual Mode, File Chooser
- üé® Theme System, Custom Layouts, Trash Bin, CSI u
- ... and more!

Yazi automatically selects the appropriate preview method for you, based on the priority from top to bottom.
That's relying on the `$TERM`, `$TERM_PROGRAM`, and `$XDG_SESSION_TYPE` variables, make sure you don't overwrite them by mistake!

For instance, if your terminal is Alacritty, which doesn't support displaying images itself, but you are running on an X11/Wayland environment,
it will automatically use the "Window system protocol" to display images -- this requires you to have [√úberzug++](https://github.com/jstkdng/ueberzugpp) installed.
