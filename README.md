## Yazi - ⚡️ Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi ("duck" in Chinese) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

💫 A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/issues/143)

- 🚀 **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- 💪 **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- 🖼️ **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with Überzug++, covering almost all terminals.
- 🌟 **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Encoding**: Combined with the pre-caching mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- 🧰 Integration with fd, rg, fzf, zoxide
- 💫 Vim-like Input component, and Select component
- 🏷️ Multi-Tab Support, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, directories, code, etc.)
- 🔄 Batch Renaming, Visual Mode, File Chooser
- 🎨 Theme System, Custom Layouts, Trash Bin, CSI u
- ... and more!

Yazi automatically selects the appropriate preview method for you, based on the priority from top to bottom.
That's relying on the `$TERM`, `$TERM_PROGRAM`, and `$XDG_SESSION_TYPE` variables, make sure you don't overwrite them by mistake!

For instance, if your terminal is Alacritty, which doesn't support displaying images itself, but you are running on an X11/Wayland environment,
it will automatically use the "Window system protocol" to display images -- this requires you to have [Überzug++](https://github.com/jstkdng/ueberzugpp) installed.
