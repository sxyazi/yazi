## Yazi - ‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi ("duck" in Chinese) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

üí´ A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why Yazi Fast?](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/issues/143)

- üöÄ **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- üí™ **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- üñºÔ∏è **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with √úberzug++, covering almost all terminals.
- üåü **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Encoding**: Combined with the pre-caching mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- üß∞ Integration with fd, rg, fzf, zoxide
- üí´ Vim-like Input component, and Select component
- üè∑Ô∏è Multi-Tab Support, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, directories, code, etc.)
- üîÑ Batch Renaming, Visual Mode, File Chooser
- üé® Theme System, Custom Layouts, Trash Bin, CSI u
- ... and more!

## Changing working directory when exiting yazi

There is a wrapper of yazi, that provides the ability to change the current working directory when exiting yazi, feel free to use it:

```bash
function ya() {
	tmp="$(mktemp -t "yazi-cwd.XXXXX")"
	yazi --cwd-file="$tmp"
	if cwd="$(cat -- "$tmp")" && [ -n "$cwd" ] && [ "$cwd" != "$PWD" ]; then
		cd -- "$cwd"
	fi
	rm -f -- "$tmp"
}
```

## Configuration

If you want to use your own config, copy the [config folder](./config/preset) to `~/.config/yazi`, and modify it as you like.

Yazi automatically selects the appropriate preview method for you, based on the priority from top to bottom.
That's relying on the `$TERM`, `$TERM_PROGRAM`, and `$XDG_SESSION_TYPE` variables, make sure you don't overwrite them by mistake!

For instance, if your terminal is Alacritty, which doesn't support displaying images itself, but you are running on an X11/Wayland environment,
it will automatically use the "Window system protocol" to display images -- this requires you to have [√úberzug++](https://github.com/jstkdng/ueberzugpp) installed.
