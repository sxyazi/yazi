## Yazi - ‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi ("duck" in Chinese) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

üí´ A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why Yazi Fast?](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/issues/143)

- üöÄ **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- üí™ **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- üñºÔ∏è **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with √úberzug++, covering almost all terminals.
- üåü **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Encoding**: Combined with the pre-caching mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- üß∞ Integration with fd, rg, fzf, zoxide
- üí´ Vim-like Input component, and Select component
- üè∑Ô∏è Multi-Tab Support, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, directories, code, etc.)
- üîÑ Batch Renaming, Visual Mode, File Chooser
- üé® Theme System, Custom Layouts, Trash Bin, CSI u
- ... and more!

## Installation

<details>

<summary>Arch Linux</summary>

Install Yazi from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yazi/) or [Arch Linux CN](https://github.com/archlinuxcn/repo/):

```bash
paru -S yazi ffmpegthumbnailer unarchiver jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide
```

You can install `yazi-bin` from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yazi/) if you perfer pre-built binaries:

```bash
paru -S yazi-bin ffmpegthumbnailer unarchiver jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide
```

If you want to use the latest git version, you can install with the following command:

```bash
paru -S yazi-git ffmpegthumbnailer unarchiver jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>macOS</summary>

Install Yazi and its dependencies with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install yazi ffmpegthumbnailer unar jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts && brew install --cask font-symbols-only-nerd-font
```

If you prefer to use the most recent code, use `--HEAD` flag:

```bash
brew install yazi --HEAD
```

Or you can install Yazi via cargo:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi.git
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Nix</summary>

The [Nix package of Yazi](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=yazi) is available. Nix users can install Yazi via:

```bash
# On NixOS:
nix-env -iA nixos.yazi

# On Non NixOS:
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.yazi
```

Or add the following to your configuration:

```nix
# configuration.nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
	yazi
];
```

You can also manage Yazi's configuration using the
[home-manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.html#opt-programs.yazi.enable).

<details>

<summary>Windows</summary>

See [Windows Installation Guide](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/wiki/Windows-Installation-Guide).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Build from source</summary>

Execute the following commands to clone the project and build Yazi:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi.git
cd yazi
cargo build --release
```

Then, you can run:

```bash
./target/release/yazi
```

</details>

## Usage

```bash
yazi
```

There is a wrapper of yazi, that provides the ability to change the current working directory when yazi exiting, feel free to use it:

```bash
function ya() {
	tmp="$(mktemp -t "yazi-cwd.XXXXX")"
	yazi --cwd-file="$tmp"
	if cwd="$(cat -- "$tmp")" && [ -n "$cwd" ] && [ "$cwd" != "$PWD" ]; then
		cd -- "$cwd"
	fi
	rm -f -- "$tmp"
}
```

## Configuration

If you want to use your own config, copy the [config folder](./config/preset) to `~/.config/yazi`, and modify it as you like.

Yazi automatically selects the appropriate preview method for you, based on the priority from top to bottom.
That's relying on the `$TERM`, `$TERM_PROGRAM`, and `$XDG_SESSION_TYPE` variables, make sure you don't overwrite them by mistake!

For instance, if your terminal is Alacritty, which doesn't support displaying images itself, but you are running on an X11/Wayland environment,
it will automatically use the "Window system protocol" to display images -- this requires you to have [√úberzug++](https://github.com/jstkdng/ueberzugpp) installed.
