## Yazi - ‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi (means "duck") is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

üí° A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- üöÄ **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- üí™ **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- üñºÔ∏è **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with √úberzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- üåü **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- üîå **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- üì° **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- üì¶ **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up to date, or pin them to a specific version.
- üß∞ Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- üí´ Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- üè∑Ô∏è Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- üîÑ Bulk Renaming, Visual Mode, File Chooser
- üé® Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, CSI u
- ... and more!
